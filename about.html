    <h3>Online Bookstore</h3>
    <p>
      The main objective of the Online Bookstore is to manage the details of Books,Customer,Payment,Delivery,Bills. <br/> 
      An online book store is a web application that allows customers to buy books online. Customers can search for<br/>
      a book by title or author using a web browser,add it to their shopping cart,and then purchase it using a debit or <br/>
      credit card transaction.Purchasing from an online bookstore will give readers the benefit of having their precious <br/>
       books delivered to them directly at home. This lowers the challenges of having to physically get to your store and<br/>
       back.When you purchase online, you save a lot of time that you would have wasted if you went to a traditional<br/>
       bookshop and wandered from store to store. Aside from that, online purchasing does not have a certain time.<br/>
       You can shop whenever you want. This is a tremendous benefit for those who are housebound or in situations <br/>
       where the weather is inclement.Our solution aims to enable the schools to continuously provide good  services<br/>
       to parents & also improve their own operational efficiency
